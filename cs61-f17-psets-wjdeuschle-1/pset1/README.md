Grading notes (if any)
----------------------
For the heavy hitter, I decided to report any site responsible for more than 
10% of the allocation size (I found this to be more informative).



Extra credit attempted (if any)
-------------------------------
I implemented my heavy hitter so that it found frequent allocations as well
as heavy allocations, as the specification suggested. If any location
made more than 10% of the total allocations, I included it in the heavy hitter
report. Additionally, I report the site making the most number of allocations
overall.
